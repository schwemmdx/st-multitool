# st-multitool
STM32 H7 Based Multiool Project for tinkering with embedded software development & electrical engineering. This project is intended for workshop use for a small budget.

This project covers various aspects of modern microcontrollers. For example the usage of DMA2D, FMC, DMA's, ADC...
For professional's sake this is done in c, not in any of these hide-away-sdk's like arduino or Âµpython.

#### Note: Project is in a very early stage, because time is limited due to the fact of my real word job. If you want, feel free to contact me and get involved !
